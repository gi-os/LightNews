/**
 * Recognising the LPIII's wheel and camera button.
 *
 * The wheel is not a rotary encoder. It is a `Pixart pat9126ja` optical sensor on
 * `/dev/input/event4` that emits one discrete DOWN+UP key pair per notch, roughly 35–60 ms
 * apart, so this is key handling and not `AXIS_SCROLL` / `onRotaryScrollEvent`.
 *
 * Light patched `/system/usr/keylayout/Generic.kl` — the layout every input device on the
 * phone loads — to relabel five scancodes:
 *
 * ```
 * key 19    WHEEL_CCW      # wheel up      (Pixart, was R)
 * key 20    WHEEL_CW       # wheel down    (Pixart, was T)
 * key 66    WHEEL_CLICK    # wheel press   (gpio-keys, was F8)
 * key 80    FOCUS          # camera stage 1 (gpio-keys, was NUMPAD_2)
 * key 27    CAMERA         # camera stage 2 (gpio-keys, was RIGHT_BRACKET)
 * ```
 *
 * Nothing intercepts these in `PhoneWindowManager`; they are dispatched to the focused
 * window like any other key. That is precisely why brightness and the flashlight appear
 * dead inside a sideloaded APK — the behaviour lives in Light's own app layer, so an app
 * that ignores the keycode gets nothing. It also means no root, no accessibility service.
 *
 * `WHEEL_CCW`, `WHEEL_CW` and `WHEEL_CLICK` are not AOSP keycodes; Light added them, so
 * their integer values are Light's to change. Hence two ways in, in order:
 *
 *  1. Resolve the label to a keycode at runtime. [KeyEvent.keyCodeFromString] reads the
 *     same native label table the keylayout parser uses, so Light's additions resolve.
 *  2. Fall back to the raw Linux scancode, which is fixed by the hardware. Scancode 19 is
 *     also `r` on a Bluetooth keyboard, so that path is gated on the device name.
